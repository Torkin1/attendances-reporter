# attendances-reporter

This file reads students names from `students` file, and reports which ones among them attended a meeting for at least `DURATION_MIN` time. The report generated also includes which meeting the student attended and how many hours have been awarded for the attendances. Each valid attendance is awarded with an hour amount equal to `HOURS_PRIZE`.

Attendances are checked searching for corresponding student names in meeting report csv files put in `meetings/` folder. Each meeting report must have the columns described in `meetings/template.csv`. The program can handle csv files with some arbitary rows (i.e. heading useless rows generated by MS Teams)

The report generated is stored in a csv file named `REPORT_NAME`.
