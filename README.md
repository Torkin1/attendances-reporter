This file reads students names from `students.txt` file, and reports which ones among them attended a meeting. The report generated also includes the name of the meetings the student attended and how many hours have been awarded for the attendances.

Attendances are checked searching for corresponding student names in meeting report csv files put in `meetings/` folder. Each meeting report must have the columns described in `meetings/template.csv`. The program can handle csv files with some arbitary rows (i.e. useless heading rows generated by MS Teams)

The report generated is stored in a csv file.
